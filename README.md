# Findslot.in - Whatsapp bot for vaccination availability and notifications

### What are we trying to build?

Starting May 1st, Indian government has started opening up vaccination slots for users above the age of 18. However, availability of a vaccination slot at a nearby hospital is an issue. Today, the system relies on individual users to log into the website and look up for free slots, almost 90% of the case there are no slots available. This pull based mechanism will delay our country's ability to get all it's citizens vaccinated. We are instead going to pivot this to a push based model where users get notified when a vaccination slot opens up near them. This ensures that no new available vaccination slots are left unclaimed.

Shubendu has already build a website called findslot.in, this website allows users to search for vaccination slots near them. We are going to extend this website by allowing users to drop in their phone number so they can receive a whatsapp notification when a slot is available near them.

### Why is this necessary?

As of May 1st only 1.8M users[1] got vaccinated versus the 2.7M users[2] that got vaccinated as of April 30th. This shows either we are running out of vaccine doses or users are unable to find an available slot on time and they are waiting it out. The former is getting fixed but the latter will not, since it's human behavior. The intent of this effort is to change that behavior by notifying users as soon as a slot is available near them.
